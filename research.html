The geometric modeling of geological structures finds applications in oil exploration.  
These structures consist of "faults" and "horizons" with water-tight
geometric partitioning (see the figure).  We are currently working towards geometric 
modeling of the structures starting from input data with unorganized points obtained from images.  
Representing geometric surfaces (called "tears") that are continuous 
is some parts of the domain and discontinuous in the other parts is the main challenge
in this work.  

The visualization of the geological structures described above also poses significant challenges
towards making the model interactive in real time.  This has also led us to carry out
research in visualization, graphics, and numerical linear algebra.  Thus, we will
be looking at various techniques including hierarchical representation, preconditioners
for linear solvers, and bounding-box techniques to render implicit surfaces efficiently.

Patient-specific treatment is possible through processing of magnetic resonance (MR) or
computer tomography (CT) images (registration, segmentation, etc.) to obtain volumetric
data containing the geometry of internal organs.  The challenges in this work included 
working with multi-material data and achieving size adaptively.  Our research enabled generation 
of provably high-quality meshes by construction of a nonconforming background mesh
that is appropriately warped or "cleaved" to conform to the boundary.  
Other main
contribution of the work includes the development of a variational system to place 
vertices in the regions of interest as seen in the figure here.  Vertex density requirement was met by assuming a
background positive change density proportional to the input and running an 
n-body particle simulation in which the vertices were assumed to possess negative charge.

Delaunay triangulation and refinement is a theoretically guaranteed technique of generating high-quality meshes. The technique produces meshes with triangular (or tetrahedral elements) with empty circumscribing circles (or spheres). The algorithm incrementally inserts vertices in a poor-quality triangle to recompute a new triangulation with better quality. I have developed a Delaunay refinement technique in which I place vertices on input segments first and then insert vertices in the domain in an advancing front manner. My algorithms work with input domains with small angles too. They produce graded meshes whose elements' areas vary over the domain. The algorithms are significantly better than current state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of theoretical guarantees.

Curvilinear meshes are obtained by first generating straight-sided meshes and mapping the 
boundary vertices their respective locations on the curved boundaries. The interior vertices
are subsequently interpolated to obtain a high-quality mesh. We use the RBF interpolation
technique with the biharmonic kernel (thin plate splines) for this purpose. The main 
contribution of this work is the Taylor series-based reasoning why the RBF-based techniques
with the biharmonic kernel have always yielded better-quality meshes when used for mesh
morphing/warping/deformation.

<img src="./img/error.png" alt="Interpolation error over quadratic triangular element" height="30%" width="30%" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0; clear: left;"/>
The analysis of error in an FE simulation is an important step in validation and adaptation of our 
numerical experiments.  Errors may arise due to several causes such as the discretization of 
the domain and the equations and the interpolation of the solution within a mesh element.  
Assessment of interpolation error bounds also provide insight into quality of a mesh element.  
Prior work has mainly focused on analysis of interpolation error within a linear 
mesh element.  We extended the work to include theoretical error bounds within
high-order straight-sided elements (see the figure), and we are currently extended the work
to curved high-order elements as well.  We were able to prove the results
from the first principles using the Taylor series rather than the use of Bramble-Hilbert lemma.  
Our results can applied in adaptive refinement and quality improvement of high-order meshes.

<h2>Parallel Log-barrier Mesh Untangling and Quality Improvement Algorithm</h2>
<p>
<img src="./img/untangling.png" alt="Mesh untangling dictated by numerical optimization algorithm" height="30%" width="30%" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0; clear: left;"/>
The presence of even a few poor-quality mesh elements can negatively affect the 
stability, accuracy, and efficiency of an FE solver.  Mesh quality improvement 
is carried out by vertex movement dictated by a numerical optimization 
algorithm (see the figure).  
We developed an interior point method-based worst element 
mesh untangling and quality improvement 
algorithm.  We improved the 
quality of the worst element in the mesh (which may be inverted) 
by reformulating a nonsmooth unconstrained optimization problem into a smooth 
constrained optimization problem and solving the resulting problem 
using a log-barrier method.  We show that 
the algorithm satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, a set of 
first-order necessary conditions, at the point of convergence.    
We also developed a parallel implementation 
of the algorithm for distributed-memory machines that uses a greedy 
edge-coloring scheme to enable parallel data transfer.

<h2> Local Mesh Quality Improvement</h2>
<p>
<img src="./img/twoangles.png" alt="Three equal angles" height="30%" width="30%" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0; clear: left;"/>
</p>
In order to improve the quality of mesh elements, we move vertices in the mesh one by one such that the quality of the elements improves in the local vicinity. We answer the question of how to move vertices and which vertices to move first. We move vertices such that a vertex maximizes the minimum angle in the local star-shaped polygon. We choose vertices based on the inequality in the quality of the elements in the polygon and the direction of their gradients.

<h2>Characterization of Mesh Quality Improvement Algorithms</h2>
We characterized some optimization techniques
by analyzing their performance in several contexts such as inaccurate and accurate 
smoothing requirements and smoothing of graded, randomly-perturbed, and 
vertex-translated meshes.  
We also characterized the performance of linear solvers and preconditioners 
when the meshes were used to numerically solve isotropic, elliptic PDEs 
after the meshes were smoothed using various geometric quality 
metrics.  The study resulted in context-specific 
assessment of performance of the mesh quality improvement techniques.

<h1>High Performance Computing</h1>
<h2>Cache Utilization</h2>
<p>
<img src="./img/sfc.png" alt="Mesh generated for a synthetic example" height="30%" width="30%" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0; clear: left;"/>
We worked on mesh element and vertex reordering techniques to improve 
the spatial locality for memory access pattern to improve cache utility 
in an implementation of a parallel algorithm
that solves Laplace's equations in order to warp a mesh.  
We used graph theoretic (reverse Cuthill-McKee) and geometric 
(Hilbert space-filling curves as shown in the figure) techniques to reorder 
mesh elements and vertices in single- and multi-core environments.  
The reordering of vertices and elements to enable efficient 
partitioning of a mesh in a shared-memory processor for parallel 
processing in a multi-core environment.  As a result of the data 
reordering, an improvement in cache utilization due to temporal 
locality was also observed.  The improvement was observed for
both stiffness matrix construction and the linear solver.  
Besides cache utilization, the performance
of block Jacobi preconditioner also improved, i.e., fewer iterations
were needed to converge to a solution, as a result of the reordering.

<h2>Aggregation for AMG Preconditioners</h2>
<p>
<img src="./img/aggregation.png" alt="Aggregates from a bottom-up technique" height="30%" width="30%" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0; clear: left;"/>
Algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioners are used in solving sparse linear system
arising from finite element meshes.  The aggregation of degrees of freedom (nodes)
in an AMG preconditioner can be carried out in a "top-down" or a "bottom-up"
fashion.  In a "top-down" technique, the nodes are recursively
partitioned until the desired number of aggregates are obtained.  
In a "bottom-up" 
technique, the desired number of partitions are first formed using a set
of nodes acting as seeds, and all other nodes associate themselves
with one of the seed nodes based on their geometric or topological
proximity.  The aggregates then iteratively reorganize themselves
by moving the seeds to the "center" of their respective aggregates,
and other nodes reassociate themselves to the nearest seed.  In this 
study, we found that our GPU-based "bottom-up" technique yields
aggregates that are topologically convex, which results in faster
solution time over "top-down" techniques.

<h1>Application in Medicine</h1>
<h2>Patient-Specific Mesh Generation</h2>
<p>
<img src="./img/ivc.png" alt="Mesh generated for a synthetic example" height="30%" width="30%" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0; clear: left;"/>
We developed a patient-specific mesh generation technique with application 
to inferior vena cava (IVC) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) blood flow simulations.  
Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially fatal disease in which blood clots travel 
from deep veins within the body and migrate to the lungs.  When anti-coagulation 
therapy fails (or is infeasible), a mechanical filter is surgically implanted in 
the IVC in order to capture blood clots.  Our technique generates patient-specific 
meshes of the IVC and the IVC filter to facilitate blood flow simulations, which 
provides surgical guidance to place the filter at a desirable 
location.  
This technique can also be used to model blood flow when stents are used to dilate 
blood vessels.  Our technique involves segmentation of patient computer 
tomography (CT) images and virtual placement of a geometric model of an 
IVC filter mesh created by a computer-aided design (CAD) software package.  
The image segmentation extracts a model of the IVC and its adjacent veins, 
and a surface mesh of the IVC is generated using the marching cubes algorithm.  
The IVC filter mesh is virtually placed in the IVC surface mesh by modeling the 
superelastic properties of IVC filter and the approximated linear elastic properties 
of the IVC. A volume mesh is generated using the advancing front technique
as shown in the figure.
