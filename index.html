        <h2>Overview of my Research Area</h2>
        <p>Simulation science is usually driven by the solution to partial differential 
equations (PDEs) using the finite element (FE) method.  
A computational pipeline that facilitates computer-aided engineering (CAE) typically 
involves following stages: geometric modeling, mesh generation, numerical 
simulation, error analysis, mesh adaptation, and visualization.   
My research has focused on <b>numeric</b> and <b>geometric</b> aspects 
of <b>scientific</b> and <b>high performance computing</b> in most of the stages of the
pipeline (see the figure below).  
As the first step in CAE, geometric models are obtained from specialized software, 
image data, or other sources.  These models are discretized to construct surface 
and volume meshes to solve discretized forms of PDEs.  High-quality meshes are necessary 
for the stability and efficiency of an FE solver and the accuracy of the associated PDE 
solution.  In order to obtain high-quality meshes, 
the quality of its elements is optimized using numerical techniques.  Analysis
of error in numerical simulations and the subsequent adaptation of meshes 
(refinement, warping, optimization, etc.) yield accurate solutions that may
be visualized to aid engineering design.

        <h3>My Projects</h3>
        <p>Specifically, I have worked on geometric modeling and visualization 
of geological structures with applications 
to oil exploration, meshing techniques (generation, optimization, and 
adaptation) with applications to patient-specific treatment, numerical 
analysis to determine error bounds in the FE method, 
and data reordering techniques to improve cache utilization.  As parts of 
the projects above,  I have also worked on numerical optimization and graph 
theoretic approaches to improve the performance of preconditioned linear solvers.
